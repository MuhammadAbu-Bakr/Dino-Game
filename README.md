## 🎮 Current Features

- 🏃‍♂️ Basic player (Dino) character controller
- ⬇️ Jump mechanic with gravity simulation
- 🌵 Static obstacle spawning
- 🌵🌵 Early endless runner setup (repeating ground and obstacles)

---

## 🛠️ Features In Progress

- 🚀 Dynamic obstacle spawning
- 🏆 Score tracking and high score system
- ⚡ Speed progression over time (difficulty scaling)
- 🌄 Background and cloud animations
- 🖼️ Game over and restart UI
- 🔥 Polishing jump animations and collider accuracy

## 🧠 Skills Being Developed

- 2D Physics (gravity, collisions)
- Character movement and animation
- Procedural obstacle spawning
- Game state management (play, pause, game over)
- Unity UI design (score, game over screen)

---

## 📈 Future Plans

- 🛡️ Add multiple obstacle types (birds, taller cacti)
- 🎨 Improve art style and background parallax effect
- 🎵 Add jump and collision sound effects
- 📱 Optimize for mobile controls (tap to jump)
